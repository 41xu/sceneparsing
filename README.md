##  Overview of ADE20k Dataset


##  Overview of ADE20k-Challenge Data
The goal of this challenge is to segment and parse an image into different image regions associated with semantic categories, such as sky, road, person, and bed. The data for this challenge comes from (http://groups.csail.mit.edu/vision/datasets/ADE20K/) which contains more than 20K scene-centric images exhaustively annotated with objects and object parts. Specifically, the challenge data is divided into 20K images for training, 2K images for validation, and another batch of held-out images for testing. There are totally 150 semantic categories included in the challenge for evaluation,, which include stuffs like sky, road, grass, and discrete objects like person, car, bed. Note that there are non-uniform distribution of objects occuring in the images, mimicking a more natural object occurrence in daily scene.
